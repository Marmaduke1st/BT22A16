# BT22A16
Actionable code to control the BT22A16 Bluetooth Relay Board

After much trial and error, I've manage to find the command that work with these relay boards.

"AT+A1" = Relay 1 Toggle,
"AT+A2" = Relay 1 On,
"AT+A3" = Relay 1 Off,

The letter change to represent the relay:
AT+A* = Relay 1
AT+B* = Relat 2 
and so on
